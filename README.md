Explorable Trie
=================

## What this is
Explorable Trie was the final project for my high school "AT Computer Science: Data Structures" course. Although we learned many data structures such as Stacks, Queues, Heaps, and Trees - we didn't get to learn about Tries.

This is an interactive "explorable" explanation of what a Trie is and how they work. It is aimed at high school students or really anyone who wants to learn more about Tries.

In order to render the Trie I used D3.js, and to set and load the state of the Trie, I used download.js to help me download the Trie as a .json file.

My code for logic and rendering is located in trie.js, HTML in index.html and css in style.css.

## What I Learned

- Visualizing data and manipulating SVG elements with D3.js
- Communicating computer science topics in an easy to understand manner in the context of a website.
- Building a custom Trie using Javascript objects.
