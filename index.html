        <h1>What is a Trie?</h1>
        <p>
            A "trie" or a "keyword tree" is a useful data structure used in search engines, dictionary applications, and even bioinformatics algorithms being taught at the UIUC<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> and the UCSD<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup>. A Trie is simply a tree that stores various possible series of tokens. Each branch represents a different possibility.
        <br><br>
            Tries allow programs that have to parse strings or any series of tokens to be very fast. According to GeeksForGeeks, "using Trie[s], search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). A Trie completes information re<b>Trie</b>val in O(N) time, which is faster than the alternative of a binary search which runs in O(NlogN) time."<sup><a href="#footnotes">3</a></sup> However, the fact that a Trie must store a large tree means that it is inefficent in terms of storage, in other words it has a high space complexity. 
        <br><br>
            
            To help you visualize what a Trie is, type in similar words in the interactive text field below to see how a trie might store tokens in a tree.
        <br><br>
            i.e. "Carrot", "Canoli", "Computer", "Curry"
