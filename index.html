        <h1>What is a Trie?</h1>
        <p>
            A “trie”, also known as a “suffix/prefix tree” or “keyword tree”, is a data structure used in search engines, dictionary applications, and even bioinformatics algorithms taught at renowned universities such as UIUC<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> and UCSD<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup>.
        <br><br>
            The Trie data structure is a type of search tree where each node has children with values that correspond to the various next possible branches of the search.
        <br><br>
            Tries are often used to parse characters in a string. Here is a Trie representation of the words “Cat”, “Car”, and “Cut”. Try tracing each node’s children to find each word.

            Tries allow programs that have to parse strings or any series of tokens to be very fast. According to GeeksForGeeks, "using Trie[s], search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). A Trie completes information re<b>Trie</b>val in O(N) time, which is faster than the alternative of a binary search which runs in O(NlogN) time."<sup><a href="#footnotes">3</a></sup> However a Trie must store all the possible branches of the search as nodes in a tree, which which makes Tries inefficient in terms of storage; in other words, Tries have a high space complexity.

            To help you visualize what a Trie is, type in similar words in the interactive text field below to see how a trie might store tokens in a tree.
        <br><br>
            i.e. "Carrot", "Canoli", "Computer", "Curry"
